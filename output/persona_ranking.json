Dolomitic and anhydritic layers: Certain sections, particularly in the Trias- sic, include harder dolomitic and anhydritic interbeds, enhancing local lithological competence. 2.6 Stress state For this analysis, the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress for each fault section is derived through spatial interpolation from the 3D numerical stress model of Germany published by Ahlers et al (2022). The range of azimuth for the area is [340◦, 336◦] with a mean value of 338◦. We consider two scenarios of present-day stress magnitudes. In the first, the stress gradients are taken from the values measured in Kronprinzenkoog (Morawietz et al (2020)) with maximum and minimum horizontal stress gradients of -19.90 MPa/km and -16.99 MPa/km, respectively, and a vertical stress gradient of -23.40 MPa/km, which are comparable with those reported by Noy et al (2012) and Fellgett et al (2018) or close to those reported by Orlic (2016). Additionally, the data from leak-off test collected from nearby exploration wells in the Dutch region (www.nlog.nl) show a mean gradient value of -16.6 MPa/km. The leak- off pressure, in many cases, can be used to estimate the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress (White et al, 2002). These values are applied linearly from the surface to the depth under consideration, resulting in a normal faulting regime. In the second scenario, the stress tensors are taken directly from the numerical stress model by Ahlers et al (2022). The main difference here lies in the gradient of the maximum horizontal stress, which, in the second scenario, is higher than the gradient of the vertical stress for depths between zero to ≈2.5 km. The predominant regime thus is a strike-slip type since the fault data set considered in this study is no deeper than 3 km. 3 Methods The slip tendency for a cohesionless or non-virgin fault is defined according Morris et al (1996) as TS = τ σ′n , (1) which is based on Amonton’s law or Coulomb-Mohr criterion on fault reactivation, which describes the initiation of a slip as τ ≥ τf = Cf − µf σ′ n. (2) Here, TS is the slip tendency, τ and σ′ n are the resolved shear stress and the effective normal stress acting along the fault’s plane, respectively (Jaeger et al (2011)), τf is the available frictional resistance of the interface, and Cf and µf are the cohesion and the frictional coefficient, respectively. The effective stress tensor is defined as σ′ = σ+I P, where I is the unit matrix and P is the pore pressure.

The Mesozoic platforms are currently the main focus of interest in the search for suitable structures for CO2 storage. The sedimentary platforms, such as the WSB, are characterised by uniform, steadily progressive sedimentation with low sedimentation rates over long periods of time and, in comparison to other regions, show minor faulting of the Mesozoic to Cenozoic overburden, e.g., see Kockel (1995). In particular, during the Mesozoic basin development, deposition and erosion in the WSB area was largely uniform over large areas. Salt flow triggered by rifting in the area of the HG, WGG, but also by increased subsidence of the neighbouring CNGB to the south, may have led to the formation of larger, more strongly bulging salt pillows along the borders of the WSB to neighbouring structural units during the Middle Triassic.

As both terms are linearly related, both sub-figures have a similar pattern and vary in scale. While the values of TS are in the range of [0.007, 0.334], those of TSnorm are in the range of [0.011, 0.695]. Most faults show a weak dependence of their slip tendency on the depth, while some faults exhibit such a strong dependence. In terms of location, critical faults with higher slip tendencies can be found at the northern and southern structures. The faults with NW/SE and NNW/SSE orientation show higher slip tendencies compared to those with other strikes, which corresponds to the azimuth of the maximum horizontal stress. Conversely, the lowest slip tendencies are observed along faults with NE/SW and ENE/WSW orientation, perpendicular to the aforementioned azimuth. The slip tendencies of the faults, grouped according to stratigraphic strata, are presented in Fig. 7, which allows a more detailed overview of the values in each layer. Faults with TS >0.31 can be found in the vicinity of Henni South within the Cenozoic, Mesozoic and Zechstein strata and above Henni North within the Cenozoic and Upper Cretaceous strata. The highest population of faults with TS >0.31 is found in the Upper Cretaceous, followed by the Tertiary and the Lower Cretaceous. In the Upper Cretaceous (Fig. 7a), higher slip tendencies (TS >0.32) are observed in the faults located along the axial region of the northern and southern Henni as well as at the southern and southwestern flank of Henni. These high values are found in the faults with strikes of [325◦, 355◦] and [140◦, 178◦]. Some faults in the west, south and south- west of Henni South extend to the Lower Cretaceous and the Upper Buntsandstein (Figs. 7a–c, see also Section 2), and these transecting faults exhibit similar trend of slip tendency with a mean value of ≈0.2. Other transecting faults along the southern structure, extending until the Zechstein layer, exhibit mainly lower slip tendencies due to its orientation with mean values of 0.16, 0.15, and 0.15, respectively (Figs. 7d–f). These results are then calculated as the maximum sustainable pore pressure change, ∆P , and its gradient, ∆P /Depth, which are shown in Fig. 8. The plot for ∆P (Fig. 8a) shows a range of [4, 213] bar and a strong dependence of the value on the depth. The critical values are observed on the near-surface faults, while high pressure windows are observed in the deeper faults, which is due to the higher confining stresses. When computed as gradients over the depth, the values are in the range of [26, 125] bar/km (Fig. 8b), and the distribution pattern changes significantly. The pattern is now closer to the one of the slip-tendency, where critical values are observed in the faults whose strikes are close to the azimuth of the maximum horizontal stress.

Considering the storage potential in the Middle Buntsandstein sandstone formation on the West Schleswig Block within the German North Sea, we investigate the reactivation and seismicity potential of existing faults in the vicinity of a selected study area. For this, we develop a 3D fault data set based on roughly 80 2D seismic lines, combining 60 years of exploration history. Contextual details regarding the geological features and the lithological description of the area are presented. Using the fault data set and the present-day stress tensors derived through spatial interpolation of the 3D numerical stress model of Germany, a slip-tendency analysis is performed to assess the susceptibility of existing faults to reactivation and reveal critical focal mechanisms, which are important for further wave propagation simulation. Furthermore, we extend the procedure to estimate the sustainable pore pressure window and the potential moment magnitude in the event of a reactivation. The results show that the NW/SE and NNW/SSE-oriented faults exhibit a higher slip tendency.
